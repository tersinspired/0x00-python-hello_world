Solution to tasks on 0x05. Python - Exceptions

Task 0: Safe list printing

Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0): my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.) All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line. x represents the number of elements to print x can be bigger than the length of my_list Returns the real number of elements printed You have to use try: / except: You are not allowed to import any module You are not allowed to use len()

Task 1. Safe printing of an integers list

Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value): value can be any type (integer, string, etc.) The integer should be printed followed by a new line Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer) Otherwise, returns False You have to use try: / except: You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer You are not allowed to import any module You are not allowed to use type()
